# cs230_design_document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wanted the game Draw it or Lose it to be designed. This game has pictures rendered that players then guess wtbe puzzle.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I was thourough in my explanations while maintaining succinctness.  


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having a place to clearly layout the needs of the project and having a UML diagram were particularly useful.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think in my reccomendations I could have been more granular in a few areas, such as memory management for one.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are of utmost importance, designing great software that does not meet needs is inevitably useless. I interpreted needs by carefully listening/reading what the client asked for, and how that can be best translated into software.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach involves planning, strategizing, and looking at the project from many angles before I delve into any coding. Ideally I have a great grasp on the scope and demands of the project, and a few ideas how to work on it. Software design requires great empathy and communication skills to set the stage for great techincal/coding skills.
